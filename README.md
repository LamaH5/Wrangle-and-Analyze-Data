# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
The goal of this project is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for good analyses and visualizations.

# Key Points
Key points to data wrangling for this project:
* Only original ratings (no retweets) that have images are required. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.
* The requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this dataset.
* Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data.
* The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.
